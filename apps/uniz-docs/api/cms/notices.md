title: "CMS notices & banners"
description: "Campus notifications and banners via user-service /cms — public and admin endpoints."
---

Served by **user-service** (not landing CMS). Gateway: `/api/v1/cms/*`.

## Typical endpoints

| Use | Path pattern |
|-----|----------------|
| Public banners | `GET /cms/banners/public` |
| Campus notifications feed | `GET /cms/notifications` |
| Admin CRUD | `/cms/admin/banners`, visibility helpers |

Portal notice board reads these for students. Landing website content is a **different** API (`landing-api` / `/cms/api`).

Auth: JWT for admin; public GETs may use `CMS_PUBLIC_API_KEY` where configured.

See [User service](/services/user) and [Admin profile API](/api/profile/admin).
